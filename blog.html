            <h2>THE GAMING OS OF LINUX</h2>
            <em>posted on 10th may 2020</em>
            <p>Hi guys.Well probably gaming on linux is the thing here.The best distro for gaming is manjaro which is a linux OS.The reason for this is that it can automatically detect your hardwares and update the graphic drivers.This OS is a Debian based one.You can play any linux steam games with this but the list for linux games is quite short, but here is the deal you can play any windows games with the help of proton which is available in steam.You can also use lutris to play any windows game available in steam.Here is another advantage of it,the graphic drivers are built in with the OS.Even google stadia uses linux servers with AMD graphics and VULKAN api.So,the future of gaming is linux.</p>
